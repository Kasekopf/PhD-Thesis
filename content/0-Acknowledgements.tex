\acknowledge
I would like to thank my advisor, Moshe Vardi, who took me in as an undergrad that had only the barest sense of how to do research.
He gave me freedom and power to explore my own ideas, yet was always ready with support and guidance when things didn't go as planned.
I couldn't have asked for a better mentor than Moshe.

I would also like to thank Devika Subramanian, Illya Hicks, and Leonardo Due{\~n}as-Osorio for serving on my thesis committee and for their many excellent suggestions.

I have been very lucky to collaborate with amazing researchers: Leonardo Due{\~n}as-Osorio, Dror Fried, Kuldeep Meel, Vu Phan, and Moshe Vardi.
Their ideas and drive were fundamental in everything I did throughout my PhD.
I am grateful to the entirety of my research group, LAPIS, where I could always find someone to debate an idea, to sharpen endless iterations of presentations, or simply to relax with after work.

I am also grateful to the friends I made at Rice along the way-- through the QGSA and GradGames, in Duncan Hall and Valhalla, on campus and off. 

I am especially grateful to my partner, Karl, who supported me from near and far for many long years.

Finally, I am grateful to my parents and siblings. Without their endless love, support, and understanding, I would not be where I am today.
