Figure \ref{fig_add} illustrates an algebraic decision diagram (ADD).

  \caption{
    The directed graph $G$ of an ADD with variable set $X = \set{x_1, x_2, x_3}$, carrier set $S = \R$, and diagram variable order $\pi(x_i) = i$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$.
    If an edge from an oval node is solid (respectively dashed), then the corresponding Boolean variable is assigned 1 (respectively 0).
