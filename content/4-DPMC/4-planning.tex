\section{Planning Phase: Building a Project-Join Tree}
\label{sec_planning}

In the planning phase, we are given a CNF formula $\phi$ over Boolean variables $X$.
The goal is to construct a project-join tree of $\phi$.
In this section, we present two classes of techniques that have been applied to model counting:
using constraint-satisfaction heuristics (in \cite{dudek2020addmc}) and using tree decompositions (in \cite{dudek2019efficient,fichte2020exploiting}).
