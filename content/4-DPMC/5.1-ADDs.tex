\subsection{Executing with Algebraic Decision Diagrams}
An \emph{algebraic decision diagram (ADD)} is a compact representation of a pseudo-Boolean function in a sparse way as a directed acyclic graph \cite{bahar1997algebraic}.
ADDs with \cudd{} were used as the primary data structure for weighted model counting in \tool{ADDMC} \cite{DPV20,phan2019weighted}.
In this work, we also use ADDs with \cudd{} to compute $W$-valuations.
This was done by Vu H. N. Phan based on \tool{ADDMC} and is not a contribution of this dissertation. We refer the reader to \cite{dudek2020dpmc} for the complete details.

Note that all other heuristics discussed in Section \ref{sec_csp} for cluster variable order can be used as heuristics for diagram variable order.
\Mcs{} was the best diagram variable order on a set of standard weighted model counting benchmarks in \cite{DPV20}.
So we use \Mcs{} as the diagram variable order for all ADDs in the $W$-valuation.
% JD: We only consider MCS in Section 6, so this paragraph is not really needed
% One challenge in using ADDs is choosing the diagram variable order.
% The choice of diagram variable order can have a dramatic impact on the size of the ADD; some variable orders may produce ADDs that are exponentially smaller than others for the same real-valued function.
% A variety of techniques exist in prior work to heuristically find diagram variable orders \cite{tarjan1984simple,koster2001treewidth,dechter03}.
% Moreover, since binary decision diagrams (BDDs) \cite{bryant1986graph} can be seen as ADDs with carrier set $S = \set{0, 1}$, there is significant overlap with the techniques to find variable orders for BDDs.
% All cluster-variable-order heuristics discussed in Section \ref{sec_csp} (\Random, \Mcs, \Invmcs, \Lexp, \Invlexp, \Lexm, \Invlexm, \Minfill, and \Invminfill) can also be used as diagram-variable-order heuristics.
% In \cite{DPV20}, \Mcs{} was the best diagram variable order on a set of standard weighted model counting benchmarks.

% ADDs were explored for weighted model counting in a dynamic-programming framework in \cite{DPV20}.
% In detail, their model-counting algorithm essentially combines Algorithm \ref{alg_csp_jt} and Algorithm \ref{alg_jt_wmc}, using ADDs as the primary data structure.
% Their two best heuristic configurations have \Mcs{} as the diagram variable order.
% The other diagram variable orders they investigated were \Invmcs, \Lexp, \Invlexp, \Lexm, \Invlexm, and \Random.
