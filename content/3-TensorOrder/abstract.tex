Constrained counting is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. A promising new algebraic approach to constrained counting makes use of tensor networks, following a reduction from constrained counting to the problem of tensor-network contraction. Contracting a tensor network efficiently requires determining an efficient order to contract the tensors inside the network, which is itself a difficult problem.

In this work, we apply graph decompositions to find contraction orders for tensor networks. % We prove that finding an efficient contraction order for a tensor network is equivalent to the well-known problem of finding an optimal carving decomposition. Thus memory-optimal contraction orders for planar tensor networks can be found in cubic time. 
We show that tree decompositions can be used both to find memory-efficient contraction orders and to factor tensor networks with high-rank, structured tensors. We implement these algorithms on top of state-of-the-art heuristic solvers for tree decompositions and show empirically that the resulting weighted model counter is quite effective and useful as part of a portfolio of counters.
