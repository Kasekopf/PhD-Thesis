I want to thank my advisor, Moshe Vardi, who took me in as an undergrad that had only the barest sense of how to do research.
He gave me freedom and power to explore my own ideas, yet was always ready with support and guidance when things didn't go as planned.
I couldn't have asked for a better mentor than Moshe.

I also want to thank Devika Subramanian, Illya Hicks, and Leonardo Due{\~n}as-Osorio for serving on my thesis committee and for their many excellent suggestions.

I have been very lucky to collaborate with amazing researchers: Leonardo Due{\~n}as-Osorio, Dror Fried, Kuldeep Meel, Vu Phan, and Moshe Vardi.
Their ideas and drive were fundamental in everything I did in my PhD.
I am also grateful to the entirety of my research group, LAPIS, where I could always find someone to debate an idea, to sharpen endless iterations of presentations, or simply to relax with after work.

I am also grateful to the friends I made along the way-- through the QGSA and GradGames, in Duncan Hall and Valhalla, on campus and off. Rice has been my home for 10 years, and I will miss the people the most.

I am especially grateful to my partner, Karl, who supported me from near and far for many long years. I could not be more excited about the future.

Finally, I want to thank my parents and siblings. Without their constant love, support, and understanding, I would not be where I am today.
