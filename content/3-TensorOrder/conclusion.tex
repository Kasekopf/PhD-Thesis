\section{Chapter Summary} \label{sec:tensors:conclusion}
We presented two methods, \textbf{LG} and \textbf{FT}, for using graph decompositions to find contraction trees of small max rank of tensor networks. \textbf{LG} is a general-purpose method for finding contraction orders, while \textbf{FT} is a novel method tailored for constrained counting to handle high-rank, highly-structured tensors. We evaluated \textbf{LG} and \textbf{FT} in the context of exact weighted model counting and demonstrated that \tool{TensorOrder} is able to solve many benchmarks solved by no other exact model counter. In particular, \tool{TensorOrder} is the best tool on benchmarks of small carving width. Thus \tool{TensorOrder} is useful as part of a portfolio of weighted model counters. 

% We proved in Corollary \ref{cor:planar-carving} that contraction trees of minimal max rank can be found in cubic time for planar tensor networks. One direction for future work is to implement and evaluate this algorithm in practice on benchmarks of planar tensor networks.
